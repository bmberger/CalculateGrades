WHAT I DID WELL: I felt like I did well in recording the user's responses and
displaying those responses back to the user.

WHAT I DID WRONG AND SOLVED: I kept trying to figure out where to put the import
statement for the Scanner, but eventually, through trial and error, I realized
that I had to put it in the main method.

WHAT I NEED TO IMPROVE ON: I think my only room for improvement is time efficency
and using more skills on a more elaborate level.
